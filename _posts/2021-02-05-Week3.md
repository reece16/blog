### Background information:  
> First, social network analysis is applicable to multiple levels of analysis. In 
> educational research, this analytical lens can be applied to students, classrooms, 
> schools, or districts. This makes it possible to study nearly any type of social system 
> characterized by relations among actors. Second, social network analysis can combine the 
> best aspects of qualitative, quantitative, and even graphical data, which allows for a 
> richer description of social life that is both contextually grounded and empirically 
> rigorous (Carolan, 2014, chapter 2).

### Key Takeaways: 
1. A binary relationship indicates whether a relationship exists between two nodes (1) or not (0).   
2. A valued relationship has weight to indicate the strength of the relationship.   
3. In a directed relationship, the relationship can be symmetric (reciprocal, two-way) between the two nodes or asymmetric (one-way).   
4. A directed network has in-degree centrality and out-degree centrality.
