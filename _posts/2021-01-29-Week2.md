### Concepts
> Perhaps one important change introduced by active learning is the facilitation of student > networks to be stronger, less centralized, or structured in some other new way to maximize > student learning. (Carolan, 2014, chapter 2) 
Since active learning is based on constructivism, how students interact with the components (peers, instructor, content) in a learning environment influences each individual's learning experience and how effectively they construct their knowledge. A well-structured less-centralized learning environment allows decentralized personalization. Each student needs to be more active in seeking their own learning networks.
