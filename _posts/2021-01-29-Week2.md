title: Week 2 - Basic Network Concepts
---

### Concepts:  
* node (actor, vertex, point, ego, agent): individual (e.g., item, person)
* edge (link, line, arc, tie): connection, relationship, interaction (undirected, directed, type, weight)
* graph
* sociogram
* matrix: (table, data frame, list, array, vector)
* complete network: complete topology, fully connected network with direct link between all paris of nodes.

* [ego networks](https://research.library.gsu.edu/c.php?g=916490&p=6612505#:~:text=Ego%20Network,are%20'surrounded'%20by%20alters): This post states that "Egocentric networks are local networks with one central node, known as the **ego**. The network is based off the ego and all other nodes directly connected to the ego are called **alters**. An Ego is the focal point of the network during data collection and analysis and are ‘surrounded’ by alters."
* [one-mode networks and two-mode networks](https://toreopsahl.com/tnet/two-mode-networks/defining-two-mode-networks/#:~:text=Most%20networks%20are%20defined%20as,et%20al.%2C%202008): This post distinguishs one-mode networks and two-mode networks that "most networks are defined as one-mode networks with one set of nodes that are similar to each other", whereas two-mode networks have "two different sets of nodes, and ties existing only between nodes belonging to different sets."

### Reflections:

Since active learning is based on constructivism, how students interact with the components (peers, instructor, content) in a learning environment influences each individual's learning experience and how effectively they construct their knowledge. A well-structured less-centralized learning environment allows decentralized personalization. Each student needs to be more active in seeking their own learning networks.   

I was wondering how important classroom interactions are to the learning outcome. Isn't that effective learning coming from connecting the new content (new node) to the individual's prior knowledge (an existing node)? To what degree does classroom interaction help in creating the tie?
